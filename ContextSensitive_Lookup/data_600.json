They attended DeSoto School, one of many private schools in the Delta established to circumvent integration. When DeSoto was opened in 1970, a dedicated cohort of white families deliberately sent their children to the newly integrated public schools, which flourished in their early years: Helena’s basketball team, a pretty picture of black and white players, became one of the best in the state. But as the economy tanked, property values plummeted, and everybody fled Helena, DeSoto—at first a minority bastion of racists—transformed into an evacuation site for the remaining white families. Helena’s public schools, Central High School and Eliza Miller, are 99 percent black. As of this writing, DeSoto has yet to matriculate a single black student. Thus, in a city so small that the combined graduating class of its high schools is fewer than two hundred students and so remote that one must drive a hundred miles to see a movie, two groups of kids grow up, one white and one black, rarely interacting.","dictionaryData":[{"id":3230,"word_id":1095,"fl":"verb","meaning":"to avoid being stopped by (something, such as a law or rule) : to get around (something) in a clever and sometimes dishonest way","count":6,"isTeacher":1,"isUser":0}]},{"word":"addict","sentence":"I was shocked by all of this, but I was shocked, primarily, by myself.

Each event in this boozy season of restaurant-hopping—whether it was wine and salmon cakes at Chez Henri or a giant chocolate fountain at the Charles Hotel—was designed to seduce you. You were meant to apply to the firm, then to work there over the summer, and finally—assuming you weren’t too obvious about your hangovers—to receive the Offer. The seduction worked in conjunction with other forces: necessity (law school debt was enormous), social pressure (everybody else was doing it), and rationalization (much of the world is run by corporations, and you should know how they work). You tried your best to blot out the advice of a law professor who called the corporate route “the path of least resistance” and suggested that “when you die, you don’t want your gravestone to say, He kept his options open.”","dictionaryData":[{"id":6311,"word_id":2092,"fl":"noun","meaning":"the act, process, or result of rationalizing : a way of describing, interpreting, or explaining something (such as bad behavior) that makes it seem proper, more attractive, etc.","count":1,"isTeacher":1,"isUser":1}]},{"word":"asphyxiating","sentence":"Between my second and third year in school, I spent a month at a law firm in Manhattan, becoming a “summer.” ","paragraph":"Between my second and third year in school, I spent a month at a law firm in Manhattan, becoming a “summer.” The work was asphyxiating, although my paycheck astonished me.

The white guy in Louisiana who’d shot the Japanese kid at point-blank range on his doorstep was charged with manslaughter, for instance, in consideration of two legally relevant factors: the “castle doctrine”—that one’s home is one’s castle, and a man has a right to defend his castle—and genuine fear. These two factors could certainly have been weighed in determining the appropriate charge for Patrick. But Patrick was not a white man living in the suburbs, so he was charged with first-degree murder.","dictionaryData":[{"id":6365,"word_id":2106,"fl":"verb","meaning":"to charge too little","count":1,"isTeacher":1,"isUser":1}]},{"word":"meticulousness","sentence":"My mother flew to San Francisco to help me unpack.

They attended DeSoto School, one of many private schools in the Delta established to circumvent integration. When DeSoto was opened in 1970, a dedicated cohort of white families deliberately sent their children to the newly integrated public schools, which flourished in their early years: Helena’s basketball team, a pretty picture of black and white players, became one of the best in the state. But as the economy tanked, property values plummeted, and everybody fled Helena, DeSoto—at first a minority bastion of racists—transformed into an evacuation site for the remaining white families. Helena’s public schools, Central High School and Eliza Miller, are 99 percent black. As of this writing, DeSoto has yet to matriculate a single black student. Thus, in a city so small that the combined graduating class of its high schools is fewer than two hundred students and so remote that one must drive a hundred miles to see a movie, two groups of kids grow up, one white and one black, rarely interacting.","dictionaryData":[{"id":3230,"word_id":1095,"fl":"verb","meaning":"to avoid being stopped by (something, such as a law or rule) : to get around (something) in a clever and sometimes dishonest way","count":6,"isTeacher":1,"isUser":0}]},{"word":"garb","sentence":"Patrick’s face had thinned.
