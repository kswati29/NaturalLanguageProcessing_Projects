    "## Word Sense Disambiguation Approach using LESK:  \n",
    "### **Step 1: Get Input**   \n",
    "  from Json:  \n",
    "    1. Get the input: word, sentence and paragraph  \n",
    "    2. Get all dictionary meanings of the word https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 2: Perform Preprocessing on \n",
    "**(a) the context (sentence/paragraph)  \n",
    "(b) dictionary data(i.e. POS(fl) and meanings).**  \n",
    "   1. Preprocessing steps on both context and dictionary data include tokenization, lower case, filter stop words and lemmatize (stemming can be explored).  \n",
    "   2. Generate a bag(list) of signatures (unique words) of the word meanings with POS.  \n",
    "   For example, one of the meaning for the word 'firm' is:  \n",
    "           POS & Meaning: 'fl': 'noun', 'meaning': 'the name or title under which a company transacts business'  \n",
    "           Generate Signature: ['noun', 'name', 'title', 'company', 'transacts', 'business']  \n",
    "   3. Genetate a bag of signature for context with POS(tag the word based on context).   \n",
    "   For example, for the word 'firm', the sentence is:  \n",
    "           Sentence: My job at the firm ended after four weeks.  \n",
    "           Generate Signature: ['noun', 'job', 'firm', 'ended', 'four', 'week']  \n",
    "   4. Remove the looked up word from both the bags (in progress)    \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Apply Lesk Algoritm**    \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Apply Cosine Lesk algorithm based on Cosine similarity.  \n",
    "   2. Convert the words to ventors and assign counts.  \n",
    "   3. Compute the cosine similarity.  \n",
    "  **Cosine similarity** is a metric used to measure how similar the documents (in our case signatures) are irrespective of their size.  \n",
    "   Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.  \n",
    "   4. Return a dataframe of the ranked order of meanings based on higher score. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 4: Generate and export Output in Json file format**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synonyms and example sentences in the dictionary data as an addition in input file to be considered for better scoring results"
